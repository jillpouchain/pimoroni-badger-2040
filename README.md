# pimoroni-badger-2040

Welcome to my repo for the Pimoroni Badger badge 2040.

Here you will find MicroPython files and projects I used with the badge.
Some of them are to getting used to it/learn how to use it, and others will be for personnal use (but happy to share!). I'll try to comment as much as possible and link sources when I was inspired by others.
