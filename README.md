# pimoroni-badger-2040

Welcome to my repo for the Pimoroni Badger badge 2040.

Here you will find MicroPython files and projects I used with the badge.
Some of them are to getting used to it/learn how to use it, and others will be for personnal use (but happy to share!). I'll try to comment as much as possible and link sources when I was inspired by others.

## Latest release

You can download the most recent MicroPython .uf2 from [the Releases page of the pimoroni-pico Github repository](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases). You'll want the special version for Badger 2040, which has the BadgerOS launcher and demos built in.
